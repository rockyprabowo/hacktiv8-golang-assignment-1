# Hacktiv8 Scalable Web Service with Golang - Assignment 1

This is the first assignment for Scalable Web Service with Golang course by Hacktiv8.

This project is a CLI-based application where the user can see their classmates' data from this course.

This project applies the programming concepts on Go I learned from the course so far.

## Usage

* Clone this repository and change the current directory to the directory where you cloned repository.
* Run this command: `$ go run . [id]` where `[id]` is the ID you want to find.
* Or, you can build this application first with `$ go build` and then execute the application with `./assignment-1 [id]` on macOS or Linux, or `./assignment-1.exe [id]` on Windows.

## Changelog
### 1.0
* Initial project, with a single "classmate" data from myself. Adding data from the other classmates are WIP.
